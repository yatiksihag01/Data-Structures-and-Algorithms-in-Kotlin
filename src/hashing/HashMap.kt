package hashing

/**
 * A custom implementation of a HashMap data structure.
 *
 * This class uses a chaining to handle collisions in hash buckets.
 * Supports basic operations such as adding, removing, and retrieving key-value pairs.
 *
 * The `initialCapacity` is coerced at 30 because a higher capacity means the underlying bucket array
 * will allocate more memory, even if itâ€™s mostly empty. Larger capacities also negatively impact cache locality.
 * The larger the bucket array, the less likely it is to fit in the CPU cache, leading to slower lookups.
 *
 *
 * @param initialCapacity The initial number of buckets in the map. Defaults to 20.
 * @param loadFactor The maximum load factor before resizing occurs. Defaults to 0.75.
 * @param K The type of keys maintained by this map.
 * @param V The type of mapped values.
